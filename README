Android heating control app

Note this project is working but requires a bit of work including adding test cases, adding options so the ssh parameters are not hard coded etc. 

Despite this, what the code actually does is quite simple as ultimately all it does is connect to a machine via ssh, forward a port and then open a webview.

This requires a number of other libraries and steps in order to work.

1. usb-thermometer (https://github.com/tomliddle/usb-thermometer) installed on a raspberry pi
2. TEMPer1F plugged in to raspberry pi
3. android-heating-app-api installed and running on raspberry pi
4. Replay switch installed using I2C on raspberry pi (http://www.byvac.com/bv3/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=103)
5. Relay switches connected to heating demand circuit on central heating.
6. Ssh installed on raspberrypi & public private keys generated.
7. Static ip or forwarding service.


Currently Ssh connection vars are stored in the code in SshPortForward. Edit username, password, hostname and ssh port
for your network.
